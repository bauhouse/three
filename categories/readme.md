## Tangible

According to the philosopher Piyush Mathur (2017), “Tangibility is the property that a phenomenon exhibits if it has and/or transports mass and/or energy and/or momentum.” A commonplace understanding of "tangibility" renders it as an attribute allowing something to be perceptible to the senses.

## Intangible

Unable to be touched or grasped; not having physical presence.

An intangible asset is an asset that lacks physical substance; in contrast to physical assets, such as machinery and buildings, and financial assets such as government securities. An intangible asset is usually very hard to evaluate. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names.

## Physical

Having material existence: perceptible especially through the senses and subject to the laws of nature. “Everything physical is measurable by weight, motion, and resistance.” — Thomas De Quincey

## Metaphysical

That which is beyond the physical: the social, the economic, and the political. For example, human consciousness and experience.
