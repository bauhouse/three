## Tangible

According to the philosopher Piyush Mathur (2017), “Tangibility is the property that a phenomenon exhibits if it has and/or transports mass and/or energy and/or momentum.” A commonplace understanding of "tangibility" renders it as an attribute allowing something to be perceptible to the senses.

### Objects

An object has identity (each object is a distinct individual). An object has state (it has various properties, which might change). An object has behaviour (it can do things and can have things done to it).

An intangible asset is usually very hard to evaluate. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names.

## Physical

Having material existence: perceptible especially through the senses and subject to the laws of nature. “Everything physical is measurable by weight, motion, and resistance.” — Thomas De Quincey
